# u/voteinfobot
A reddit bot created using PRAW, reddit's python API.

I created this bot in August 2020 to automatically post resources information about voting in the 2020 election on reddit based on keywords in posts. I found it to be especially important during that election cycle that people know how to exercise their right to vote, given that there was a lot of mixed messaging and disinformation on topics like mail-in ballots.
